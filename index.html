                    <p>Welcome to my awesome website. This site was created as part of Aalto University's Digital Fabrication 2026 course, and its main purpose is to serve as a learning diary and documentation of my personal work during the course.</p> 
                    <p>Part of the course's learning objectives are related to website development, so I will be updating this site in terms of content, looks and functionality as we go.</p>
