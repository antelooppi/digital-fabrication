                <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>My name is Antero. I'm a sound, lighting and video designer and a musician. I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Sound in New Media programme at Aalto University.</p>
                    <p>As a sound designer, I'm obviously interested all things related to sound. However, the main focus of my interests are almost always shifting as I like to try and learn new things. Lately, I have been really into instrument building and creative coding. As a musician and sound designer, different instruments are an essential part of my work. It has been super exciting to jump on the maker wagon and start designing and building my own tools. During the Digital Fabrication courses, I'm hoping to learn new approaches and techniques that will help me on this journey.</p>
