                <h1>Assignment 02: Media Optimization and Copyright</h1>
                    <h2>Image Optimization</h2>
                        <p>For image optimization task, I used GIMP. I began by loading the source material (an image taken with my phone) to the program and used the rotate tool to straighten it. I then used the crop tool with 21:9 aspect ratio to select the part of the image I wanted to present. After that, I scaled the image width to 1000 pixels. Keeping the aspect ratio locked, the scaling made the final image of a size 1000x429px. As a last step, I exported the image as a progressive .jpg using 75 percent quality. By doing these steps, I was able to compress the image size from 2,2 MB to 109 KB.</p>

                    <h2>Screenshot Optimization</h2>
                        <p>I started this assignment by taking a screenshot with my Mac. I uploaded the image to GIMP and used the crop tool with 21:9 aspect ratio. After that, I “highlighted” a part of the image by adding a transparent black layer over the parts I didn’t want to be highlighted. To achieve this, I started by adding a new transparent layer over the image. I then used the select tool to select the part I wanted to be highlighted. After that, I inverted the selection and used the paint bucket tool to fill the area with black colour. Finally, I adjusted the black layer opacity around 85 percent.</p>
                        <p>I added the text over the image with the text tool and aligned it to the center of the image. As a last step, I scaled the image to 1000x429 pixels and exported  it as a progressive .jpg using 75 percent quality. As the final result, I was able to reduce the original 1,9 MB screenshot size to 45 KB. </p>

                    <h2>Copyright, Licensing and AI Matters</h2>
                        <p>I chose to restrict all use of my data on my website, at least for now. I chose this over using Creative Commons license, since I’m not yet sure what I’m going to fabricate as an end project during these courses. One of my ideas is to further develop the synthesizer I have designed and built myself. I am not yet sure whether I will commercialize this instrument in the future. For this reason, I do not necessarily want to share my files for public use at this stage. I might change this in the future, though.</p>
                        <p>I also chose to restrict all data usage on my website for training AI modules. I made this by using <a href=https://site.spawning.ai/spawning-ai-txt#ai-text-generator">Spawning's ai.txt generator</a> and uploaded the file to the website's root directory.</p>
