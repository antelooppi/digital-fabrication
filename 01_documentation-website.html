                <h1>Assignment 01: Documentation Website</h1>
                    <p>I created this website using VSCode and Github Pages. I don't have much prior experience on web development, so I decided to work only with HTML and CSS. I also wanted the site to be light and clear, which led to the minimalistic design you are experiencing right now.</p>
                    <p>At the time of writing this, all the pages use the same visual structure. The structure consists of three areas: the top navigation bar, the main content of the page and the footer. The visual layout has been build with CSS Grid, using individual dividers for each one of the areas. Inside the dividers, I'm using semantic HTML elements, like &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="Media/01 Documentation Website/html-example.jpg" alt="A picture of the website's index page written in HTML.">
                        <figcaption>The index page written in HTML.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Learning the basics of CSS Grid was really helpful when designing the visual structure of the website. The full power of it won't probably be realized on my simple three-piece vertical layout, but at least I have the option to try more complicated design choices in the future if I want to. Where CSS Grid really came in handy was in dividing the visual layout into separate sections, positioning them, and adapting them to the browser size in a meaningful way.</p>
                    <p>One goal I'll try to keep in mind when updating this site, is to make it as accessible as I can. I want the site - at least in theory - to be readable not only by me, but by all kinds of people with different equipment. This is a learning process for me, so I probably won't get it right the first time. Nevertheless, I want at least to try to learn how to use things like semantic HTML, color and font choices, and media optimization in a thoughtful manner.</p>
