                <h1>Assignment 03: Computer-Aided Design</h1>
                    <h2>My background with Computer-Aided Design</h2>
                        <p>Before taking the course, I didn’t have much experience with computer-aided design, when referred to 2D and 3D drawing. I had tinkered a little with programmes like Shapr3D and Fusion360 beforehand, but had not yet properly explored the possibilities of parametric modeling. I’m excited to dive deeper into CAD, since I see many possibilities in it for designing, prototyping, and eventually manufacturing physical objects. I am particularly interested in learning how to draw for laser cutters, CNC machines, and 3D printers so that I can realize my ideas in the material world. In the future, I hope to develop enough skills to fabricate parts for musical instruments, installations, and other projects, while using computer-aided tools to make sensible and functional design solutions during the manufacturing process.</p>
                    <h2>The Model</h2>
                        <p>For this week's assignment, I made a 3D parametric model of a potentiometer knob using three different sketches in FreeCAD. I began on the XZ‑plane by creating a side view of the knob in the Sketcher workbench. Starting from the origin, I used the Polyline tool to draw the rough shape I had in mind, focusing on getting the overall proportions in place. After that, I added construction geometry to help define the angle where the inner and outer rings meet. To make the pointer part of the knob, I created a second sketch perpendicular to the first and used the Rectangle tool to draw its shape. As a third sketch, I drew circles on the XY-plane to outline the holes to the bottom of the knob.</p>

                        <p>After drawing the initial shapes, I constrained the sketches. For the side‑view sketch, I started by using horizontal and vertical constraints to make the lines straight. After that, I used the Dimension tool to define the main dimensions, such as the height, inner radius, and outer radius of the knob. Lastly, I defined the angle where the inner and outer rings meet by using the angle constraint between two construction geometry lines. For the pointer sketch, I created a point on the bottom line of the rectangle and used the symmetric constraint to lock it to the midpoint. I then used a coincident constraint to attach that midpoint to the origin. Finally, I defined the height and width of the rectangle. For the bottom‑hole sketch, I locked all the circles’ center points to the origin using coincident constraints and then defined their diameters to fully constrain the sketch.</p>

                        <p>After constraining the sketches, I used the Revolution tool in the Part Design workbench to create the main 3D shape of the model from the side‑view sketch. I had drawn only half of the knob’s profile in the Sketcher workbench so I could use the vertical sketch axis as the rotation axis. Because the sketch represented only half of the shape, revolving it around the axis produced the full circular form. After creating the main body, I used the Pad tool to add the pointer feature to the 3D model. As subtractive steps, I used the Pocket tool to create the holes at the bottom of the knob and refined several edges with Chamfer and Fillet tools to give the part a smoother and more finished appearance.</p>

                        <p>I created six adjustable parameters (Height, Inner Radius, Outer Radius, Pointer Width, Hole Diameter, and Bottom Ring Angle) inside the Spreadsheet workbench to make the design parametric. These values are linked to multiple constraints across the sketches, so changing one parameter updates several dimensions at once. Some dimensions of the model utilize mathematical expressions instead of direct values of the parameters. For example, the pointer length follows the expression (OuterRadius − InnerRadius) / 2 + InnerRadius, which keeps the pointer tip centered on the outer ring regardless of the chosen dimensions. Most features adapt correctly when parameters are being changed, but unrealistic values can still break the sketch. For instance, the outer radius cannot be smaller than the inner radius. Within reasonable limits, however, the spreadsheet makes the model flexible and easy to modify.</p>
