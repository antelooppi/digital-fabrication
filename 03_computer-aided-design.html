                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                        <p>Before attending this course, I had very little experience with CAD. One could argue otherwise, since as a sound designer I regularly use computer‑aided tools for creative design. However, in this context I’m referring specifically to 2D and 3D drawing. Before the course, my only real exposure was tinkering with Shapr3D, which gave me a basic understanding of parametric modeling. I’m excited to dive deeper into CAD because I see many possibilities for designing, prototyping, and eventually manufacturing physical objects. I’m especially interested in learning to draw for tools such as laser cutters and 3D printers to bring my sketches into the material world. In the future, I hope to develop enough skills to fabricate parts for my instruments, installations, and other projects, and to use CAD as a tool for spotting design issues before fabrication.</p>
                    <h2>The Model</h2>
                        <p>For this week's assignment, I made a 3D parametric model of a potentiometer knob using three different sketches in FreeCAD. I began on the XZ‑plane by creating a side view of the knob in the Sketcher workbench. Starting from the origin, I used the Polyline tool to draw the rough shape I had in mind, focusing on getting the overall proportions in place. After that, I added construction geometry to help define the angle where the inner and outer rings meet. For the pointer, I created a second sketch perpendicular to the first and used the rectangle tool to form its basic shape. As a third sketch, I drew circles on the XY-plane to outline the holes to the bottom of the knob. </p>

                        <p>After drawing the initial shapes, I constrained the sketches. For the side‑view sketch, I started by using horizontal and vertical constraints to make the lines straight. After that, I used the dimension tool to define the main dimensions, such as the height, inner radius, and outer radius of the knob. Lastly, I defined the angle where the inner and outer rings meet by using the angle constraint between construction geometry lines. For the pointer sketch, I created a point on the bottom line of the rectangle and used the symmetric constraint to lock it to the midpoint. I then used a coincident constraint to attach that midpoint to the origin. Finally, I defined the height and width of the rectangle. For the bottom‑holes sketch, I locked all the circles’ center points to the origin using coincident constraints and then defined their diameters to fully constrain the sketch.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>After fully constraining the sketches, I used the Revolution tool in the Part Design workbench to create the main 3D shape of the potentiometer knob from the side‑view sketch. I had drawn only half of the knob’s profile in the Sketcher workbench so I could use the vertical sketch axis as the rotation axis. Because the sketch represented only half of the shape, revolving it around the axis produced the full circular form. After creating the main body, I used the Pad tool to add the pointer feature to the 3D model. As a subtractive step, I used the Pocket tool to create the holes at the bottom of the knob. As a final touch, I refined several edges with chamfers and fillets to give the part a smoother and more finished appearance.</p>

                        <p>For the spreadsheet, I created six adjustable parameters that control different parts of the potentiometer knob: Height, Inner Radius, Outer Radius, Pointer Width, Hole Diameter, and Bottom Ring Angle. These values are linked to multiple constraints across the sketches, so changing one parameter updates several dimensions at once. Some relationships needed expressions instead of direct values. For example, the pointer length follows the expression (OuterRadius − InnerRadius) / 2 + InnerRadius, which keeps the pointer tip centered on the outer ring regardless of the chosen dimensions. Most features adapt correctly when parameters change, but unrealistic values can still break the sketch—for instance, the outer radius cannot be smaller than the inner radius. Within reasonable limits, however, the spreadsheet makes the model flexible and easy to modify.</p>
